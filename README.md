todo
====

This [todo app](http://furti.github.io/todo) stores all it's data inside the browser. So nothing is sent to any server. But that means you should always use the same browser to access the app or your previous notes will not be available. There is also no way of synchronizing the notes between different devices.

###Creating Notes
To create a note double click in the column the note should be appended to.

###Deleting Notes
To delete a note click on the trash icon inside the header and confirm the dialog.

###Editing Notes
Double click on the notes text to edit it. After you have changed the text click outside of the note and the text will be updated.

###Moving Notes
To move a note drag it to another column.

###Export
To export the data click on the cog in the top right corner and choose *Export / Import*. Click on *Generate Export* and copy the data in the textarea to a texfile of your choice.
